```

### EmotionEntry
Links tasks to emotions with temporal context.

- `emotionId`: string - Reference to Emotion.id
- `type`: enum - 'creation' | 'completion'
- `timestamp`: timestamp - When emotion was recorded
- `userId`: string - For security/validation

**Validation Rules**:
- taskId: Must reference existing task
- emotionId: Must reference valid emotion
- type: Required, only 'creation' or 'completion'
- One 'creation' entry per task, zero or one 'completion' entry per task

**Firebase Firestore Schema**:
```javascript
{
  id: "emotion_entry_uuid_456",
  taskId: "task_uuid_123",
  emotionId: "anxious",
  type: "creation",
  timestamp: firestore.Timestamp,
  userId: "firebase_user_uid"
}
```

### User
Individual using the system with preferences and sharing context.

**Fields**:
- `uid`: string - Firebase Auth UID (primary key)
- `email`: string - User's email from Firebase Auth
- `displayName`: string | null - User's display name
- `createdAt`: timestamp - Account creation time
- `preferences`: object - User settings
- `sharedWith`: array<string> - UIDs of users who can see this user's tasks
- `sharedFrom`: array<string> - UIDs of users whose tasks this user can see
- `lastActiveAt`: timestamp - For activity tracking

**Preferences Object**:
```javascript
{
  defaultView: "list" | "grid" | "dashboard",
  emotionReminders: boolean,
  notificationsEnabled: boolean,
  preferredEmotions: string[], // Emotion IDs for quick access
  workingHours: {
    start: "09:00",
    end: "17:00",
    timezone: "America/New_York"
  }
}
```

**Validation Rules**:
- email: Required, valid email format
- displayName: Max 50 characters
- sharedWith/sharedFrom: Max 10 users each (prevent spam)

### Dashboard (Virtual Entity)
Aggregated analytics views - computed from other entities, not stored directly.

**Analytics Computed**:
- Weekly emotion distribution (creation emotions)
- Monthly completion rates by emotion
- Emotion change patterns (creation ‚Üí completion)
- Task completion velocity trends
- Suggested task priorities based on current emotion

**Sample Dashboard Data Structure**:
```javascript
{
  period: "week", // "week" | "month"
  startDate: "2025-09-03",
  endDate: "2025-09-10",
  emotionDistribution: {
    excited: { count: 5, percentage: 25 },
    anxious: { count: 8, percentage: 40 },
    tired: { count: 7, percentage: 35 }
  },
  completionRates: {
    excited: { completed: 4, total: 5, rate: 0.8 },
    anxious: { completed: 3, total: 8, rate: 0.375 },
    tired: { completed: 2, total: 7, rate: 0.286 }
  },
  emotionChanges: [
    { from: "anxious", to: "excited", count: 3 },
    { from: "tired", to: "calm", count: 2 }
  ],
  suggestions: {
    currentEmotion: "tired",
    recommendedTasks: ["task_uuid_789"], // Low-effort tasks
    reasoning: "Based on your current emotion, here are some easier tasks"
  }
}
```

## Relationships

### Task ‚Üî EmotionEntry
- One-to-Many: Each task has one creation emotion entry, optionally one completion emotion entry
- Foreign Key: EmotionEntry.taskId ‚Üí Task.id

### User ‚Üî Task
- One-to-Many: Each user owns multiple tasks
- Foreign Key: Task.userId ‚Üí User.uid

### Emotion ‚Üî EmotionEntry
- One-to-Many: Each emotion can be used in multiple emotion entries
- Foreign Key: EmotionEntry.emotionId ‚Üí Emotion.id

### User ‚Üî User (Sharing)
- Many-to-Many: Users can share tasks with each other
- Implemented via: User.sharedWith and User.sharedFrom arrays

## State Transitions

### Task Status Flow
```
pending ‚Üí completed (when user marks task done)
pending ‚Üí deleted (when user deletes task)
completed ‚Üí deleted (when user deletes completed task)
```

### Emotion Entry Flow
```
Task created ‚Üí EmotionEntry (type: "creation") created
Task completed ‚Üí EmotionEntry (type: "completion") created (optional)
```

## Security Rules (Firebase)

### Task Collection
- Users can only read/write their own tasks
- Users can read tasks from users in their `sharedFrom` list
- Users cannot modify tasks they don't own

### EmotionEntry Collection
- Users can only read/write emotion entries for their own tasks
- Cascade deletion when task is deleted

### User Collection
- Users can only read/write their own user document
- Public read access to displayName for sharing features
