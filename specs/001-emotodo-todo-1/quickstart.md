```

## Test Data Setup

### CRITICAL: Emotion Initial Data (MUST BE CREATED FIRST)
```javascript
// These 7 emotions MUST exist in Firestore before any other tests
const requiredEmotions = [
  { id: "excited", name: "Excited", emoji: "üéâ", color: "#10b981", category: "positive", energy: "high", displayOrder: 1 },
  { id: "motivated", name: "Motivated", emoji: "üí™", color: "#3b82f6", category: "positive", energy: "high", displayOrder: 2 },
  { id: "calm", name: "Calm", emoji: "üòå", color: "#06b6d4", category: "positive", energy: "medium", displayOrder: 3 },
  { id: "neutral", name: "Neutral", emoji: "üòê", color: "#6b7280", category: "neutral", energy: "medium", displayOrder: 4 },
  { id: "tired", name: "Tired", emoji: "üò¥", color: "#f59e0b", category: "negative", energy: "low", displayOrder: 5 },
  { id: "anxious", name: "Anxious", emoji: "üò∞", color: "#f97316", category: "negative", energy: "low", displayOrder: 6 },
  { id: "overwhelmed", name: "Overwhelmed", emoji: "üòµ", color: "#ef4444", category: "negative", energy: "low", displayOrder: 7 }
];
```

### Required Test Users
```javascript
// Primary test user
{
  email: "test@emotodo.com",
  password: "testpass123",
  displayName: "Test User 1"
}

// Secondary test user for sharing
{
  email: "test2@emotodo.com", 
  password: "testpass123",
  displayName: "Test User 2"
}
```

### Sample Tasks for Testing (Create AFTER emotions)
```javascript
const testTasks = [
  {
    description: "Review quarterly sales report",
    emotionId: "excited",
    micronote: "Finally time to see our progress!"
  },
  {
    description: "Schedule dentist appointment",
    emotionId: "anxious", 
    micronote: "Not looking forward to this..."
  },
  {
    description: "Organize desk workspace",
    emotionId: "tired",
    micronote: "Easy win for today"
  }
];
```

## Performance Validation

### Real-Time Updates Test
1. Open EmoTodo in two browser tabs (same user)
2. Create task in Tab 1
3. Verify task appears in Tab 2 within 100ms
4. Complete task in Tab 2
5. Verify completion appears in Tab 1 within 100ms

### Offline Functionality Test  
1. Disconnect internet connection
2. Create new task (should succeed with offline indicator)
3. Reconnect internet
4. Verify task syncs to server within 5 seconds

### Mobile Responsiveness Test
1. Open on mobile device (or browser dev tools)
2. Verify responsive layout adapts correctly
3. Test touch interactions for emotion selection
4. Verify dashboard charts are readable on small screens
